# Racktables monitoring plugin


This is an additional plugin for RackTables, that creates a monitoring tab
right beside the object page. The plugin is based on Racktables Nagios Plugin
v.0.1 from Mogilowski Sebastian <sebastian@mogilowski.net> (
http://www.mogilowski.net/projects/racktables ).

You can configure multiple monitoring servers (supported and tested: Nagios,
Icinga) in the configuration tab - each one with different CSS and JavaScript
URLs. The monitoring instance is selected via a RegEx for each object.

Example:
* URL:   https://nagios.example.com/cgi-bin/status.cgi
* RegEx: example.com
* => For all machines containing a FQDN with "example.com", the nagios.example.com machine will be queried.

* URL:   https://icinga.local/cgi-bin/status.cgi
* RegEx: local
* => For Machines with a FQDN ".local", the icinga.local machine will be queried.

While the configuration tab allows to enter a default username and password to
log in to the monitoring server, I strongly recommend to use the fallback
solution and leave the fields empty.
 
A nice feature might also be the additional CSS and JavaScript URLs you can
configure, which allows to customize the look and feel.
